# Chain-Reaction-Game
A game I made on my phone during a car ride

- Corners require one dot to explode, edges two, everywhere else three
- Things explode in directions left, right, up, and down

TO-DO:
- fix glitch where other player can do his turn while player's turn isn't finished

Play this on [my website](http://crispbit.com/Games/Chain-Reaction/):
